          <h3>Importance of healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            Healthcare and welbeing forms a prominent part of overall quality
            life as well as life expectancy. It is so important that it has been
            listed as one of the United Nations SDGs for as ‚ÄúGood Health and
            Wellbeing‚Äù and can even be part of the Welsh Government‚Äôs future
            generations goals for a ‚ÄúHealthier Wales‚Äù

          <h3>The healthcare problem</h3>
          <p>
            Many sources agree that the metrics used to measure the general
            health of a society are not improving despite advancements in
            technology and medicine. While each source will point the finger at
            different causes for this problem, most agree that Covid-19 played a
            large role in the decline of health overall.

      <h2>Children's Health in Wales</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>‚ö°Current Situation</h3>
        <p>
          The current situation as portrayed by the BBC is bleak. It tells the
          tale of many children having many health related problems such as
          obesity, mental health issues and tooth decay. This idea is further
          built upon by the British Medical Associations' article showing that
          the times for diagnositc tests on the NHS is very long and getting
          longer.
        </p>
        <h3>üóíÔ∏èPossible Causes</h3>
        <p>
          Covid-19 can be seen as a key contributor to all the health related
          problems. Many children suffered loneliness and their development may
          have been affected by spending years inside. It is also possible that
          as many people didn't even go to the doctor or any medical
          professional certain issues like tooth decay were not able to be
          picked up on early.
        </p>
        <h3>üé¨What is being done</h3>
        <p>
          The government states that they are "committed" to improving
          healthcare after an open letter from health professionals from 20
          different organsiations was written. There are also reaseachers at
          Cardiff University that also found out that excersise can improve many
          aspects of life including, obesity and mental health
        </p>
        <h3>ü§ûThe outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, waiting lists are still getting longer for diagnostic tests
          with many people having to wait more than 36 weeks for tests. However,
          while there are no current metrics directly about children's health,
          life expectancy is dropping still which could show there is an issue
          with healthcare or the general health levels of general society.

      <h2>Possible solutions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            Improving education particularly around healthcare related matters
            in Wales could improve poor health outcomes by allowing both adults
            and children to make more informed lifestyle choices and make better
            usage of the healthcare services that are available for them.
            Education plays a crucial role in understanding preventative
            measures, nutrition and healthy eating and mental health, equiping
            people to make healthier descisions. Additionally, this should allow
            more people to maintain meaningful employment as they take less time
            off being unwell meaning the government can recover more money in
            taxes to fund the NHS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Increase Funding</h3>
          <p>
            Increasing NHS funding in Wales could improve health outcomes by
            reducing wait times, increasing access to services and enhancing the
            quality of care. With more resources available, the NHS could expand
            staff numbers and invest in modern equipment and technology allowin
            for faster diagnosis and more effective treatments. Further
            investment in the NHS could provide more consistent and high quality
            care for Welsh communities ultimately leading to a healthier
            population and less strain on healthcare resources.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Recruit more doctors</h3>
          <p>
            Recruiting more doctors in Wales could greatly improve health
            outcomes by addressing critical shortages, reducing wait times and
            ensuring patients recieve timely care. With high numbers of doctors,
            the NHS could manage demand more effectively allowing for shorter
            appointment wait times. More doctors could also reduce the stress
            felt by overworked existing staff which could reduce turnover rates,
            staff burnout and improve job satisfaction. All this leads to a
            higher quality of care.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Preventative care</h3>
          <p>
            Expanding preventative care in Wales could significantly improve
            health outcomes by addressing health issues before they become
            servere or expensive to treat. Preventative care, including regular
            checks and vaccinations can help catch diseases early. It can also
            encourage a healthier lifestyle which lowers risks associated with
            smoking, poor diet and inactivity. By investing in preventative care
            measures the, Wales could reduce the burden on the NHS and improve
            overall health outcomes making healthcare more sustainable and
            accessible long term.
